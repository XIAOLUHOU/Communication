A very long message - This algorithm supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits; defaulting to 256 bits. In .NET Framework, this algorithm supports block sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits; defaulting to 128 bits (Aes-compatible). In .NET Core, it is the same as AES and supports only a 128-bit block size.
