Cryptographic Proofs
Cryptographic proofs from raw data values are generated directly at the source to guarantee the dataâ€™s integrity and authenticity.
Trust Channel
In addition to the regular data transfer, the cryptographic proofs are transmitted by a separate secure communication channel to the trust layer.
Hardware-based security
The support of trusted execution environments for different types of devices provides the highest security level for the data verification process.
Uncompromised scalability
A very low footprint of memory- and computation-resources ensures a scalable data verification process on any granularity, even for high-frequency data streams.
